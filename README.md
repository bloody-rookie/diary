## My diary

#### 17th-may-2025
So today I'm just gonna start this new format of diary writing, it'll also help me improve my git skills, and it's totally under my control of how I wanna format my diary. It's morning, and I've plan to visit institute with my buddies Abhishek and Madhu, but there's less chance because we're going to collect our certificates and Madhu thinks that the certificate should be *better collected on sunday*. Anyway yeah let's see how long I'll keep writing diaries like this.
*Update (20:45):* I'm back, and tired. It was a really hot day like I was literally bathing with sweat, but yeah anyway I and Abhishek got our certificates (including Rahul's). We talked a lot, about many stuffs, he told about his new girlfriend. Madhu didn't come, but I don't care tbh I called her a lot, she didn't respond, her loss. Conclusion: A fun and tiring day.
