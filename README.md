## My diary

**17th-may-2025**: So today I'm just gonna start this new format of diary writing, it'll also help me improve my git skills, and it's totally under my control of how I wanna format my diary. It's morning, and I've plan to visit institute with my buddies Abhishek and Madhu, but there's less chance because we're going to collect our certificates and Madhu thinks that the certificate should be *better collected on sunday*. Anyway yeah let's see how long I'll keep writing diaries like this.
